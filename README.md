Welcome to the public repository for Incredible Arcade Machine! This is a free and open-source game developed by Magikus Studios, and it features clones of retro games such as Snake, Tetris, Pong, Asteroids, and Brick Breaker. This repository contains the full source code for the game, including all of the C# scripts and Unity assets.

If you're interested in game development, feel free to take a look at the code and learn from it. You can also modify the code and assets to create your own version of the game, or use them as a starting point for your own projects.

At Magikus Studios, we're committed to helping other developers create their own games more efficiently and effectively. That's why we've decided to release Incredible Arcade Machine as an open-source project. We believe that sharing knowledge and resources is essential for the growth of the game development community.

Thank you for checking out our project, and happy coding!
